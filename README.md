# first_os
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/MaciejSzybiak/first_os.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/MaciejSzybiak/first_os)

first_os is a kernel based on Philipp Oppermann's [blog_os](https://os.phil-opp.com/) made for educational purposes.

Currently the kernel is capable of these basic features:

 * printing text to screen using VGA buffer
 * printing text to a serial port (for testing)
 * catching CPU interrupts and exceptions
 * allocating heap memory for its own use
